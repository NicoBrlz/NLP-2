# NLP-2
School Project - NLP


Guidelines : 

Scraping and data exploration

In this second project, you will be tasked with preparing a database by collecting information from various sources, such as customer review sites, articles on cybersecurity, etc.
We can scrap these websites
https://fr.trustpilot.com/
yelp (with api)
https://www.opinion-assurances.fr/
you also can find a website (please validate with your teacher)

You can also use this dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_kg5JzAzntzLI6eGM3_vmUSoeWk7f8ip/view?usp=sharing

You will then undertake an initial exploration of the data, including data cleaning, visualization, and the production of initial conclusions. This step is crucial to establish a solid foundation for subsequent projects.


Supervised learning

In the second phase, supervised learning and unsupervised learning will be utilized. You will need to create a supervised text processing model using NLP techniques. In addition to modeling, you will need to develop an interactive application where users can submit text in the chosen theme and receive a prediction, along with explanations for that prediction. This will allow you to apply your NLP skills in a practical manner.

Examples of supervised tasks
Sentiment analysis
Number of stars
Categories/subjects
for insurance reviews for examples, claims, subscriptions, etc.
for restaurants, type of dish, service vs. food
Streamlit applications
For one review, give detailed information (food, service, etc.) cf Amazon review
For one restaurant, a summary about this restaurant, more detailed criteria
For restaurants, QA system : “I want very good and expensive sushi”, “restaurant rapide et bon”
